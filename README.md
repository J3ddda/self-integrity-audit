A reflection tool to help people stay grounded in their values and recognize manipulation or grooming.



# 🧭 Self-Integrity Audit Tool

A self-check-in framework to stay grounded in your truth, especially when navigating subtle power dynamics, emotional manipulation, or confusing relationships.

---

## ✨ Why this exists

Sometimes, manipulation comes dressed as mentorship. Grooming often hides behind praise, opportunity, or pseudo-care. This tool is for anyone who wants to stay rooted in their clarity, voice, and autonomy.

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

Use this reflection whenever something feels "off" in a personal, professional, or intellectual relationship.

---

### 1. 🧠 Clarity
> “Am I thinking more clearly *after* I interact with this person… or less?”

### 2. 🗣️ Voice
> “Do I feel more able to express my full self with this person… or more cautious?”

### 3. 🧍‍♀️ Sovereignty
> “Are my choices expanding—or am I being steered toward *one* ‘right’ path?”

### 4. 🔄 Feedback Loop
> “Can I question or challenge this person openly without punishment or guilt?”

### 5. 📉 Energy
> “Do I feel consistently drained, indebted, or overexposed after we connect?”

### 6. 🔍 Truth Test
> “If I pull back and imagine them having *zero power or knowledge*—do I still trust their motives?”
